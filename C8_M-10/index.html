The notes are further designed to help students complete timely revisions and score better marks in the exams.</p><h2>Introduction to Fraction, Ratios and Percentages</h2><p>In this chapter "Comparing quantities", students of Class 8 will learn to find the Discount when discount percentage is given. Also, we will learn here cost price, sales tax, GST (Goods and Services Tax), along with compound interest.</p><h3>Fractions, Ratios and Percentages</h3><p>A <span>fraction</span> represents a <span>part of a whole</span> which consists of <span>numerators</span> and <span>denominators</span> and it is the division of <span>two same quantities</span>.<br><span class="frac"><span class="num">1</span><span class="bar"></span><span class="den">4</span></span>, <span class="frac"><span class="num">1</span><span class="bar"></span><span class="den">5</span></span>, <span class="frac"><span class="num">2</span><span class="bar"></span><span class="den">3</span></span>, etc.</p><p><span>Ratio</span> is the comparison of one value to the other or the <span>comparison of two different quantities</span>.<br>Eg: 3:5</p><p><span>Percentage</span> is a value that expresses the part of a whole or a fraction of 100. For example, 10% of 100 is equal to <span class="frac"><span class="num">1</span><span class="bar"></span><span class="den">10</span></span> of 100, i.e., 10.</p><h3>Finding Increase or Decrease Percentage in Situations</h3><p>Finding new number, when there is <span>increase</span> in percentage. New number = original number + (increase in percentage × number)</p><p><span>Example : The Cost of a mobile phone is Rs 15,000. Find the new price if there is a increaseof 5%</span><br><span>New price</span> = <span>original price</span> + 5% of <span>original price</span></p><p><span>New price</span> = 15,000 + (<span class="frac"><span class="num">5</span><span class="bar"></span><span class="den">100</span></span> × 15,000)</p><p><span>New price</span> = 15,000 + 750 = <span>15,750</span></p><p>Here <span>Rs 750</span> is <span>increase</span> in the price.</p><p>The new number can be found using:<br>New number = original number × percentage increase</p><p>Example:<br>New price = 15,000 × <span class="frac"><span class="num">105</span><span class="bar"></span><span class="den">100</span></span> = 15,000 × 1.05 = 15,750</p><p>Finding new number when there is decrease in percentage:<br>New number = original number - (decrease in percentage × number)<br>Also, New number = original number × percentage decrease</p><p>Example:<br>The cost of a mobile phone is Rs 15,000. Find the new price if there is a decrease of 5%<br>New price = 15,000 × <span class="frac"><span class="num">95</span><span class="bar"></span><span class="den">100</span></span> = 15,000 × 0.95 = 14,250</p><h2>Finding Discounts</h2><h3>Finding SP without Finding Discount Percentage</h3><p>A <span>reduction</span> (decrease) on the <span>marked price</span> is known as <span>discount</span>.<br>If the discount is given in numbers then it is calculated by<br><span>Discount = Marked price – Sale price</span></p><p>If the discount is given in percentage then it is calculated by:<br><span>Discount = Discount % of Marked price</span></p><h3>Finding Discounts</h3><p>If the <span>discount</span> is given in numbers.<br>Example: Marked price of a shirt is Rs 535. Its selling price is Rs 495.<br>Solution: Discount = Marked price - Sale price = Rs 535 - Rs 495 = Rs 40</p><p>If the <span>discount</span> is given in percentage.<br>Example: A toy priced Rs 500 is available at a discount of 5%.<br>Solution: Discount = 5% of 500 = <span class="frac"><span class="num">5</span><span class="bar"></span><span class="den">100</span></span> × 500 = Rs 25</p><h3>Estimation of Amounts (In Percentages)</h3><p>Estimating <span>amounts</span> when there is a <span>discount</span> or <span>hike</span> on the marked price.</p><p><span>Example</span>: Anil bought a pair of shoes priced Rs 650 at a discount of 10%.<br><span>Solution</span>: Billing amount = Marked price - discount = Rs 650 - <span class="frac"><span class="num">10</span><span class="bar"></span><span class="den">100</span></span> × 650 = Rs 650 - Rs 65 = Rs 585</p><p><span>Example</span>: Shilpa bought a new mobile for Rs 15,000. She has to pay 2% as delivery charges.<br>Find the billing amount.<br><span>Solution</span>: Billing amount = Marked price + Hike<br>Billing amount = Rs 15,000 + <span class="frac"><span class="num">2</span><span class="bar"></span><span class="den">100</span></span> × 15,000<br>Billing amount = Rs 15,000 + Rs 300 = Rs 15,300</p><h2>Prices Related to Buying and Selling</h2><h3>Prices / Charges Related to Buying and Selling</h3><p><span>Profit</span> = Selling price - Cost price<br><span>Profit %</span> = <span class="frac"><span class="num">Profit</span><span class="bar"></span><span class="den">Cost Price</span></span> × 100<br><span>Loss</span> = Cost price - Selling price<br><span>Loss %</span> = <span class="frac"><span class="num">Loss</span><span class="bar"></span><span class="den">Cost Price</span></span> × 100</p><h3>Finding Prices / Charges Related to Buying and Selling</h3><p><span>Example</span>: A shopkeeper sold a T.V priced Rs 12,000 at Rs 13,500.
