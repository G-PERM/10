Robots use sensors to perceive the world, processors to reason, and actuators to move or manipulate objects. Design choices balance capability, safety, cost, and energy efficiency for the intended environment. Robots operate in many forms: fixed manipulators, mobile platforms, aerial drones, underwater vehicles, and humanoids. Software stacks implement perception, planning, control, and human-robot interaction layers. Testing begins in simulation and moves to hardware-in-the-loop before field deployment. Maintenance, firmware updates, and secure communication are essential for long-term reliability. Ethics, privacy, and safety standards guide responsible robot design and deployment. Robotics is a collaborative discipline: mechanical, electrical, software, and domain experts working together. Clear interfaces and documentation help teams iterate and maintain robotic systems effectively.</p><h2>Core components</h2><ul><li><strong>Mechanical</strong> — frames, links, joints, grippers, wheels, legs.</li><li><strong>Sensors</strong> — cameras, LiDAR, ultrasonic, IMU, tactile, microphones.</li><li><strong>Actuators</strong> — DC/BLDC motors, servos, steppers, linear actuators, pneumatics.</li><li><strong>Controllers</strong> — microcontrollers, SBCs, real-time OS for deterministic control.</li><li><strong>Power</strong> — batteries, power distribution, charging strategy, power management.</li><li><strong>Software</strong> — drivers, middleware (like ROS), perception, planners, safety modules.</li><li><strong>Communication</strong> — CAN, I2C, SPI, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MQTT, secure channels.</li></ul><h2>Sensing and perception</h2><p>Vision systems detect objects, people, and lanes using cameras and deep learning models. Depth sensing (RGB-D, stereo, LiDAR) builds 3D maps for navigation and manipulation. IMUs provide orientation and short-term motion tracking; encoders measure joint positions. Tactile and force sensors enable safe grasping and compliant interaction with fragile objects. Sensor fusion combines modalities to reduce noise and increase robustness in real environments. Perception pipelines include filtering, segmentation, classification, and pose estimation. Real-time requirements dictate on-device processing for latency-sensitive tasks. Edge inference and optimized models let robots run perception without constant cloud roundtrips. Calibration and periodic re-calibration keep sensor outputs aligned and accurate. Privacy-preserving perception (on-device anonymization) protects users while keeping functionality.</p><h2>Motion, actuation and control</h2><ol><li>Actuators provide torque or linear force—choose based on precision, torque, and backdrivability.</li><li>Transmission (gearboxes, belts) trades torque for speed and affects control fidelity.</li><li>Low-level control uses PID, feedforward, and encoder feedback loops for position/velocity.</li><li>Mid-level planners generate trajectories respecting kinematic and dynamic constraints.</li><li>High-level behaviors use state machines, behavior trees, or learning-based policies.</li></ol><computercode aria-label="Code block code1" class="computercode" id="code1" role="region"><button aria-label="Copy to clipboard" class="copy-btn" title="Copy" type="button"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="14" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="14"><path d="M16 1H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v12h2V3h12V1zm3 4H8a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v14a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h11a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V7a2 2 0 0 0-2-2zm0 16H8V7h11v14z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg></button><div aria-hidden="true" class="copy-badge" role="status"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" viewbox="0 0 24 24" width="16"><path d="M9 16.17L4.83 12 3.41 13.41 9 19 21 7 19.59 5.59z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg> <span>Copied</span></div><div class="code-content" spellcheck="false"># Simple robot loop (python-like pseudocode)<br>import time<br>def read_sensors():<br>    # returns {'dist': value, 'imu':(...), 'camera':...}<br>    return {'dist': 25}<br>def step():<br>    s = read_sensors()<br>    if s['dist'] &lt; 10:<br>        stop_motors()<br>    else:<br>        move_forward()<br>while True:<br>    step()<br>    time.sleep(0.05)</div></computercode><h2>Common applications</h2><ul><li>Manufacturing: precise, repeatable assembly and inspection.</li><li>Healthcare: surgical assistance, rehabilitation, logistics in hospitals.</li><li>Agriculture: automated seeding, monitoring, and targeted spraying.</li><li>Exploration: planetary rovers and underwater ROVs for science missions.</li><li>Service: reception, guidance, cleaning, and last-mile delivery robots.</li><li>Education: programmable kits and interactive teaching robots for STEM skills.</li><li>Search &amp; Rescue: rugged mobile robots for dangerous environments.</li></ul><h2>Design &amp; testing practices</h2><p>Start with requirements, sketch mechanical concepts, build CAD models and BOMs. Simulate sensors and dynamics in Gazebo, PyBullet, or similar to catch obvious issues. Use hardware-in-the-loop and staged testing to validate control before full deployment. Implement safety features: e-stops, watchdog timers, soft limits, and collision avoidance. Plan maintenance: spare parts, actuator calibration, and firmware update procedures. Log telemetry and monitor remotely to detect degradations early and schedule preventive maintenance. Document APIs, wiring, and calibration steps clearly — good docs speed up future fixes. Prioritize security: signed firmware, encrypted channels, and access control to prevent tampering. Engage users early to refine interfaces and to ensure the robot meets real needs. Iterate quickly with modular designs to reduce risk and speed improvements.</p><h2>Famous robots and examples</h2><h3>Rashmi</h3><img class="paspo" src="/rashmi.png"><p>Rashmi is a humanoid robot designed for rich multilingual interaction with regional audiences.
