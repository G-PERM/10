## One-Time Path Adjustment (MANDATORY)

This project uses the `/10/` URL prefix by default.

After cloning the repository, you **MUST** perform the following steps.

---

### Step 1 — Run the script (ONE TIME ONLY)

From the project root, run:

```bash
python .py
```

This command updates all `.html` and `.css` files in place.

---

### Step 2 — DELETE THE SCRIPT (REQUIRED)

After the script finishes running:

- **DELETE `.py`**
- **DELETE THE SCRIPT IMMEDIATELY AFTER RUNNING IT**
- **DO NOT keep the file**
- **DO NOT commit the file**
- **DO NOT run it again**

---

### THIS SCRIPT MUST NOT EXIST AFTER RUNNING

`.py` is a **one-time utility**.

After it has been executed:

- **DELETE `.py`**
- The file **must not exist** in the project anymore

If the script still exists after running it, the setup is **NOT complete**.
