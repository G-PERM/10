The bricks from the site were used for the construction.</li><li>It was about 80 years ago that archaeologists could realize that it was an ancient city.</li></ul><h3>What was special about these cities?</h3><ul><li>Mohenjo–Daro, Kalibangan, Lothal and Dholavira are some other important sites of the Indus Valley Civilization. About 150 sites of this civilization have been discovered till date.</li><li>Most of the sites of this civilization are in modern day Pakistan. Some of the sites are in India, e.g. Kalibangan (Northern Rajasthan), Banavali (Haryana), Dholavira (Gujarat) and Lothal (Gujarat).</li><li>After excavations from different sites, it has become clear that this civilization was spread over major parts of western India and Pakistan and some parts of Afghanistan.</li></ul><h3>Town Planning</h3><ul><li>These cities show immaculate town planning.</li><li>The city of Harappa was divided into two parts, i.e. western and eastern parts.</li><li>A huge tank has been found within the citadel. This has been named as the Great Bath by archaeologists. This was made from baked bricks.</li></ul><p>→ Rich people lived in the upper part of the city.</p><p>→ Workers lived in the lower part of the city.</p><h3>Use of Baked Bricks</h3><ul><li>Houses and other structures were made of baked bricks.</li><li>Bricks were of uniform size which means that the people of Harappa had developed good workmanship.</li></ul><h3>Roads and Drainage</h3><ul><li>Roads were paved with bricks.</li><li>The drainage system was properly planned. Drain from each house was connected to the drains in the streets.</li></ul><h3>Planned Houses</h3><ul><li>The walls of the houses were strong and thick.</li><li>Some of the houses were two storey high which shows the well-developed architecture in those days.</li></ul><h3>Granaries</h3><ul><li>In the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization, a large granary has been found. Charred grains have been found in these granaries which shows that food grain production was surplus during this period.</li></ul><p>→ Historians also guess that taxes were collected in the form of grains.</p><p>→ Grains collected as tax were stored in such large granaries.</p><h3>Life of the People</h3><h3>Craft</h3><ul><li>Clay, copper and bronze were used for making pots. Tools, weapons and seals were made from copper and bronze.</li><li>Seals were also made from clay. Some large pots have also been found and were probably used for storing grains.</li><li>Jewelleries were made of gold, beads, wood and clay. Precious stones like carnelian, jasper, crystal, etc. were used to make beads.</li><li>Clay and wood were used for making toys. Ornate carvings can be seen on toys, pots and jewellery.</li></ul><h3>Trade</h3><ul><li>Trade was the main occupation of people of Harappa.</li><li>Copper came from Rajasthan and from Oman.</li><li>Some seals from Harappa have been found in Mesopotamia, which shows that trade link existed between Harappa and Mesopotamia.</li><li>A dockyard has been discovered in Lothal in Gujarat, which shows that trade through sea route existed at that time.</li></ul><h3>Farming</h3><ul><li>Remains of charred grains have been found which shows that wheat, barley, pulses, pea, rice, sesame, linseed and mustard were grown in the villages of the Harappa Civilization.</li><li>A toy model of plough has been found from the ruins which shows that plough was used for tilling the land.</li><li>Bones of many domesticated animals have been found from the excavation site which shows that people of Harappa domesticated cattle, sheep, goat, buffalo and pig.</li></ul><h3>Other Aspects of Life</h3><ul><li>Historians guess that the city had some form of administration. A committee may have looked after the city's needs.</li><li>People used some form of entertainment. This is evident from toys and statues found from the site.</li><li>Seals show scripts, indicating people knew how to write.</li><li>Many statues have been found. One figure is similar to the Hindu god Shiva, suggesting worship of gods and goddesses.</li></ul><h3>Mystery over Decline of Harappa Civilization</h3><ul><li>The Harappa Civilization suddenly declined around 3900 years ago. Broken roads and clogged drains indicate a collapse in city infrastructure.</li></ul><p>→ The rivers may have dried up, forcing migration.</p><p>→ Too many brick kilns and furnaces could have led to deforestation and environmental damage.</p><p>→ Overgrazing may have resulted in desertification.</p><p>→ An epidemic or natural calamity may have wiped out the population.</p><h2>MCQs – Indus Valley Civilization (Harappan Civilization)</h2><p><span>1.
